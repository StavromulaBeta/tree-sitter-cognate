# tree-sitter-cognate

The vim plugin is great but for a wider reach of editor support a tree-sitter
grammar is needed. Working on this instead also lets me procrastinate on my
other WIP project, an online cognate playground, for which I've decided to not
simply use a server and a sandbox and wrap around the official cognate CLI (and
instead make everything purely frontend).

My cognate knowledge is extremely, extremely limited partly due to the
unfinished status of the official tutorial, and partly due to my being an
exceptionally slow reader of C source code. I was quite intrugued by ideas in
this language and since no one else seems to be working on these (tree-sitter
and online playground)... Here we are.
